- Added an API request to the coinlayer API. The results are logged
  in the console for now
- The request is triggered by the button 'Get Exchange Rates'
- Added the Rates cmp
- Added react router to navigate between components
- Moved functionality from App cmp to Rates cmp
- Changed the render() method of the App cmp => Now it only renders the
  balance of the wallet's account
